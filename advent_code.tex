\section{Introduction}

This is my attempt to solve the Advent of Code 2022 problems in \LaTeX3.

Following from last year, I'm abandoning the \Verb!dtx! file format and using just a normal \LaTeX\ file and will input a \LaTeX3 file that actually contains the code.

\section{Solutions}

\subsection{Day 01}

I'm not a fan of optimisation for its own sake, so for the second part of the challenge then I used a scratch sequence which I prepopulated with three zeros.
After working out each elf's quota, I added it to the sequence, then sorted the sequence, and removed the smallest value.
This is decidedly not optimal, but it was fast enough.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The largest amount of calories carried by a single elf is: \MaxCalories*{Day01}
\item The amount of calories carried by the three elves carrying the most is: \MaxCalories{Day01}
\end{enumerate}
